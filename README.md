# Reconstructing-Early-African-American-Film-History
This project was created by UCLA students and faculty members  to reconstruct and revive the history of early African-American silent race films.  The interest for this project was sparked by the Johnson Negro Film Collection at UCLAâ€™s Charles E. Young Research Library. The intention behind this project was to address an unwritten history, through a structure that would be the most effective for academic research.
